Version 0.2.0
=============

:Date: July 13, 2023

Added
-----

* dynamic adaptation of the RePa zoom in `SphericalBase` to control the size
  of the generated grid on the spherical surface.
* add a `fusion_level` parameter on VGG and VAE models in order to control
  the left and right hemispheres fusion level.
* RandomAugmentation: aplly an augmentation with random parameters defined in
  intervals.
* SurfNoise, HemiMixUp, GroupMixUp: new spherical augmentations.
* Transformer: register augmentation tranformations and apply them with custom
  probabilities.

Changed
-------

* SphericalRandomCut -> SurfCutOut
* SphericalRandomRotation -> SurfRotation

* normalize weights in RePa.
* DiNe: change how missing nodes are handle during the neighborhood generation.
